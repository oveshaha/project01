<h2> Food </h2>
    Food, substance consisting essentially of protein, carbohydrate, fat,
    and other nutrients used in the body of an organism to sustain growth and vital processes and to furnish energy.
    The absorption and utilization of food by the body is fundamental to nutrition and is facilitated by digestion.
    Plants, which convert solar energy to food by photosynthesis, are the primary food source. 
    Animals that feed on plants often serve as sources of food for other animals. 
    To learn more about the sequence of transfers of matter and energy in the form of food from organism to organism, 
    see food chain.
    Hunting and gathering, horticulture, pastoralism, and the development of agriculture are the primary means by which
    humans have adapted to their environments to feed themselves.
    Food has long served as a carrier of culture in human societies and has been a driving force for globalization.
    This was especially the case during the early phases of European trade and colonial expansion,
    when foods such as the hot red pepper, corn (maize), and sweet potatoes spread throughout Europe to Africa and Asia.

        <h2> Carob <i> (Ceratonia siliqua)</i> </h2>
        tree of the pea family (Fabaceae), grown for its edible pods. Carob is native to the eastern Mediterranean region
        and is cultivated elsewhere. The ripe dried pods can be ground into a powder that is somewhat similar in flavour to cocoa,
        and carob powder, chips, and syrups are commonly used as an alternative to chocolate in health-food products.
        The names locust bean and St. John’s bread stem from the belief that the “locusts” on which John the Baptist fed were 
        carob pods.
    
        
       The tree, about 15 metres (50 feet) tall, has pinnately compound (feather-formed) glossy evergreen leaves with thick leaflets. 
       The red flowers are followed by flat leathery pods 7.5–30 cm (3–12 inches) long.
       The pods contain 5 to 15 hard brown seeds embedded in a sweet edible pulp.
